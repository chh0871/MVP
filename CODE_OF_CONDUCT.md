# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the cherry community pledge to make
participation in our work a respectful and harassment-free experience for
everyone. 

We are united beyond any and all physical characteristics and personal beliefs, by a shared commitment to save the environment from the
undeniable destruction of the fashion industry, protect charity itself from digitalisation and subsequent high
street decline, and develop a revolutionionary way in which people can donate online.
Those who participate in good faith and contribute to this mission share equally
in the privileges of membership in our community.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that keep our community open, welcoming,
and focused on the collective impact we can achieve together for cherry's
charitable and environmental goals.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness towards other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologising to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community
- Acting in ways that advance cherry's mission to protect the environment from
  the harms of the fashion industry and to keep charitable work grounded in
  human connection rather than unchecked digitalisation

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

- The use of sexualised language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[cherry.org.uk](mailto:info@cherry.org.uk). All complaints will be reviewed and
investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
